One year into our relationship, when I began wondering how to be sure about my affections and if my love for him was the enduring sort, my brain bellowed in alarm, as if I were treading too near a cliff. I was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">supposed</em> to love this person. In tethering myself to him, I had, I thought, chiseled for myself a trenchant path, one that marched confidently toward the horizon, unswerving. Happiness lay in the way of practical love. The only choice that mattered was my choice to be with this man, because it was the only one that seemed reasonable. Whatever doubt prickled at the back of my neck now, it was not to be trusted.</p><p name="d2a1" id="d2a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My future ex-husband and I dated for more than three years before he proposed, and then we didn’t marry for another two years. In that time, I would, with performed cool, survey everyone who was close to me, sussing out their views on my relationship and thus reiterating to myself that my decision to commit to this person was the best choice. I was markedly less demure during conversations with my therapist, wherein I would pick apart my significant other, breaking him into smaller, more discrete shards and examining each one with terror. I demanded to know: Was it normal to harbor the annoyances and quibbles that so often reared their heads? These were inconsequential — they couldn’t possibly mean that I didn’t love him. Right? <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Right?</em></p><p name="1879" id="1879" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Love cannot be solved for or unearthed like seashells hidden by sand — it leaves no certain traces. But having determined myself to be an emotional hazard, I ultimately decided to hand myself over to inertia. I had been happy enough with a man who was good and who believed himself to be good for me: better to marry him and spare myself from ruminating further.</p><p name="4db2" id="4db2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was an absurd conclusion to reach, I would later realize, because the marriage was a catastrophe — or perhaps it’s more accurate to say that I was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">catastrophic</em>, a veritable bull barreling through a china shop stuffed with wedding crystal and flatware and Le Creuset. I wanted to divorce mere months after the wedding. I fell in love with someone else. I cheated. And when I became overwhelmed by my own brutality, I overdosed on Tylenol.</p><p name="6893" id="6893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After coming clean to my then-husband and being discharged from the hospital, I possessed no greater urge to stay married. However, my behavior seemed only to reify what I thought to be the case: I couldn’t trust my own impulses. Surely my only recourse was to recommit to the man who was trying to forgive me, to do penance, to find, somewhere within my reeling heart, a docile and loving wife.</p><p name="a759" id="a759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I began conducting surveys again, though I knew it was folly. No one could tell me it was better to remain married. Friends responded to my leading questions — “Clearly this will get better?” — with sympathetic, helpless shrugs. By now I had a new therapist who, much to my chagrin, would not tell me either to weather the matrimonial course or to jump ship.</p><p name="9829" id="9829" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How do people know when to leave?” I would plead. Her response was always gentle, always obscure: “People leave when they can’t stand to stay.”</p><p name="6b60" id="6b60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gradually and begrudgingly, I accepted that there was no logic to rely upon, no expert’s opinion on the State of My Union. I — Crazy Rachel, the mess, the girl whose heart seemed to hold a million tiny selves, clawing at its walls — had to choose.</p><p name="fb7b" id="fb7b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“If you leave, you’ll be okay,” my mother told me over the phone. “Me?” I thought. “How is that possible?” But I appreciated the vote of confidence, without quite understanding why: I was slowly, achingly making up my mind.</p><p name="d208" id="d208" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People leave when they can no longer stand to stay. Or people leave when they feel they must. It’s a form of knowledge, this illumination, but the visceral sort — the “gut feeling” half the world tells us to heed, while the rest admonishes against following it too slavishly. I’m not sure where I stand on that matter. But at last it occurred to me that my emotions have never been indecipherable or in conflict; they’ve merely been loud. And when I finally consented to hear them, I stood like a pillar against their crashing chorus, waves upon waves squalling in unison. I had always known my own heart; I’d known it too well and foolishly thought it would be more convenient to ignore.</p><p name="ad8c" id="ad8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I told him that I had to leave; he didn’t protest. The next morning, I walked out into the broad blue of the May sky, wriggling my left ring finger, now unadorned. I was skittish, astonished at my own audacity. How could I possibly be this sure?</p><p name="18d0" id="18d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And yet I was. I am.</p>
